  My personal portfolio with GatsbyJS
</h1>

<p>This project has been a 6-months-long journey into this beautiful framework that is React, using GatsbyJS to smooth it out.</p>
<p>This is also meant to be my first personal web development project.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>As a first personal and unframed project, I wanted this to be as <span font-style="italic">light, simple and user-friendly</span> as any website should be.</p>
<p>I also wanted this project to represent me as I am: with my qualities, but not flawless.</p>

<h2>Theme development</h2>

<p>Still laking of little bit of knowledge regarding the choice of colors and fonts, I started with a white background and red-ish header.</p>
<p>I decided to transform the whole thing when, for fun and a little headache, I tried the google's dark mode on my render.</p>
<p>Now, I'm proud of this dark and red theme, even if anything isn't perfect !</p>
